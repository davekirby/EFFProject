#report 

Write user guide on how to use the library.

# Context
intro to GP and FIS?  Maybe copy from the body of the report and cut down.  Or copy back into the report.

Need to give enough information to make the hyperparams and other params understandable. 



# General (both classifier and RL)

- explain all the hyperparameters
- tensorboard support
    - TensorboardX writer
- fit method
- predict method
- methods to get best rule
- saving and loading
- can use alternative mate and mutate methods by subclassing
- can also override the execute method

# Classifier


# GymRunner

# General advice
- refer to GP handbook.
- start small and increase size (rules, pop etc) as needed
