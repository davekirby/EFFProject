Still left to implement:
- evaluate method
- fix mate and mutate methods to handle lists of trees

So how do I do the mate and mutate?  This obvious answer is to select one/two chromosomes from the individuals and use that with the existing gp methods.  
Alternatively randomly select a rule to replace completely, or two rules to swap over.   Make the prob configurable so I can play around with it.

I have add the methods but not tested anything yet.  Will need to figure out how to do meaningful tests.  Gonna commit for now and maybe test tomorrow or over the weekend.

Ran the code...
Damn, it fails in VarAnd function because it tries to delete the fitness from a thing that is not an Individual.  I think I need to change the \_mate and \_mutate methods to return new individuals.
I will leave that to tomorrow.
