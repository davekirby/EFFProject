Carrying on implementing the GP engine in the classifier.   Took yesterday evening off, so not sure where I got to.  
Added eaSimpleWithElitism function.  

To add the GP learning to the fit method:
- add hyperparameters to the init method
- register functions in the toolbox
- create initial population
- create stats & HOF objects
- call eaSimpleWithElitism
- store resultant population and logbook

Add a warm-start option? don't create initial population, assume it is already there.
Add saving & loading of state.  

I have registered the functions except 
- need to implement the evaluate method
- need to change the mate and mutate methods to handle lists of trees

May refactor the code out into a separate class that can be reused outside of the classifier - maybe as a mixin?
