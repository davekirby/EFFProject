Having a crack at writing the pruning function - will probably not get finished tonight.  

... I have a successfully failing test.  It did not recognise the conseqents though, so I have left that as an empty list.

...cool, I got the basic cases working - removes duplicate branches and multiple inverts.

ToDo:
- add more tests
- add code to run it on a ruleset & a population
    - run every time create or modify an individual
- generate a population and see what effect it has on the sizes.  How much does it really save?  How long does it take?
- see what effect it has on speed and convergence
