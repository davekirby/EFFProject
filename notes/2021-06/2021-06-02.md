Finished exams so coming back to this - did not get to spend any time on it when revising so need to catch up fast.  
I was in the process of implementing a simple FIS for classification using Simpful.  I want to implement the same engine using other libraries for comparison - at least the sklearn one and fuzzylite.  

ToDo:
- [x] flesh out the kanban with pages behind it.
- [x] create some tasks for this - use tasks plugin to manage them.
- [ ] set up VNC connection from laptop.
