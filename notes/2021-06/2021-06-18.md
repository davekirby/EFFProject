I added a unit test for generating a Rule Set from a chromosome.  I am happy to mark the story as done.  
The next story is to implement the fitness evaluator for classification.  
This will require taking a chromosome and generating the set of rules from it, then applying the rules to a pandas dataframe and returning the result.   This is a slight extension to the existing classifier class that I have created  so should not be much work.
