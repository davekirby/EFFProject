I am working on the fitness evaluator for the classifier.  This should be pretty straightforward.
I have found that code in the Hand-On book for elitism results in duplicate items from the HOF appearing in the population - because it can copy over items from the previous population unchanged and then appends the current HOF, they can be selected twice.  In the population I looked at it happened less than I expected - 4 duplicates in a population of 100 after 30 epochs.  
There are quite a lot of other duplicates in the population though - one rule appeared 7 times and there are only 71 rules that are unique, so maybe it doesn't matter that much.

**21:11** I have added code to the Classifier class to do all the initialisation and run the classifier prediction with a random rule set.  Have not tested it yet though.

**21:44** Nearly working - when I try to predict on the iris dataset, it fails with `ValueError: Unexpected input: sepal\_length`.  Will investigate in the morning.
