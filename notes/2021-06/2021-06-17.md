Took the evening off yesterday due to extreme hay fever.  
On Tuesday I got a list of rules created for the chromosome. 
I want to port the code into python functions and add unit tests.  

So what do I want the function(s) to do:
- make a primitiveSet from antecendents and consequents
- register Individual, IndividualCreator and PopulationCreator with the toolbox/creator
- create a dataclass to pass in configuration parameters, with reasonable defaults.

**22:19**  I have moved the code into python functions but not tested it yet.  Will do that tomorrow.
