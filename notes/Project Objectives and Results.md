#report 
- Successfully created a fuzzy classifier and RL agent using GP
- works well on small datasets and gym environments
- limitations
    - handling large number of features
    - speed
    - rate of convergence

Show results + tensorboard plots for typical run on iris dataset.  
Also show results for cartpole and mountain car.
- or save for the full results section.  

**13:27** I have added a write up for Classifier and gymrunner.    What else?  Maybe a short bit saying the evaluation is in the later section and leave it at that.
