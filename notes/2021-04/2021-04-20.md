Still having trouble accessing the memory stick from Obsidian - have to mount it as a directory to read/write to it, and it keeps vanishing.  May have to work with it on my local system and sync to the memory stick from time to time.  Bugger.

Seems a bit more stable so far with the memory stick plugged into my PC instead of the hub.  We shall see how it goes.

# TODO
Think about the components and start work on them...
Gonna copy the MD file for the report into here so I can include it in Obsidian.

Next step is to create a simple FIS with fuzzylite and maybe some of the other libraries so I can compare them and benchmark them.  Use hand-coded rules & set definitions on a toy problem.  Play around with the fuzzy libraries in ipython/jupyter.
