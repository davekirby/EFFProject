First Markers's comments
The student has written a few pages reporting on the background research. However, the presentation is sometimes repetitive and lacks analysis in depth. Also, an analysis of the existing systems of this type is not detailed enough. Section 3 “Problems and objectives” is too brief and messy. The statement of the problem is different from what’s written in the introduction, where the problem was presented from a company’s standpoint rather than a person’s one. I could not understand what the author means by the aims and objectives. The plan and methodology look reasonable, though more details could be provided, in particular regarded the testing. As I wrote above, the proposal is a bit messy, sometimes repetitive. There are quite a few typos and errors in the text.
