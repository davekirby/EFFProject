Last thing yesterday I changed the code to re-evaluate all the population every batch and then recreate the HOF.  Will run it again to see what difference it makes. I ran it yesterday and it looks like:
1. the rule size grows quite a bit
2. it converges slightly better than before, but still not great.  
This is with a batch size of 50, 5 generations.  
I need to create a page for cataloging results and designing experiments.  Will do that tomorrow.
