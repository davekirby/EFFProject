Issues to address:
- slow run time
    - replace fuzzy system
        - cython/numba version of the skfuzzy library
        - different fuzzy library completely
            - fuzzylite C implementation?
        - remove unnecessary re-evaluating
            - only appropriate if no batching
    - train on a subset of the data?
        - pick out two classes and train against them?

- not converging enough - low accuracy
    - lack of expressive power?  
        - increase rule/tree size
    - too large a search space?
        - reduce terms to 3 - low, medium, high
        - decrease rule/tree size
    - lack of diversity?
        - reduce mating & increase  mutating
