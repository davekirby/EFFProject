I will experiement with the image segmentation dataset today:
- download and examine it
- write a script to run the classifer on it
- extend the script to do random search of hyperparameters
- add minibatch learning?

I have downloaded the dataset in ipython as Pandas.  It is cool you can do that and automatically split into data and target:
```python
data, target = fetch_openml(data_id=40984, as_frame=True, return_X_y=True)
```
region.pixel.count can be removed, since there is only one distinct value (9).

Maybe refactor out into a function the bulk of the code in the iris classifier.  The only thing that will change are the dataset to use and the hyperparameters.

Strange... pycharm hangs with 150% CPU if I try to extract a method from top-level code.   Had to refactor the function by hand.
I have the basic CV function extracted and working. 
To add:
- hyperparameters
- tensorboard directory
    - repurpose the to_tensorboard parameter

... running the classifier on the new dataset.  Very slow, as expected.  I bumped up the rule size parameters too.


It runs but the accuracy needs a lot of improvement - currently around 40-50%.

I think I can fix both accuracy and speed by adding mini-batch processing, but we shall see.
