Started on [[Experiment and Tune Classifier 5sp]] - looking into data logging & analysing tools for ML workflow.

What i have in mind is a notebook where I can edit the hyperparms and run the classifier against a data set.  It logs the result to tensorboard and then commits itself to git.  
Question:  can I automatically get a notebook to save itself so the latest version is committed?  Time to google...
... looks like it can't easily be done from jupyterlab.   One idea:  run a bash cell with xdotool to do ctrl-S to save the file.  Sleep for a bit (5s?) then git commit.  Will that work?

Strange... when I run `xdotool key ctrl+s` in a jupyterlab cell it pops up a dialog saying it is trying to connect to zotero.  No idea where that came from!
However ctrl+shift+C does pop up the command window, so I could type in "save" and save the notebook that way.  Damn, seems to have stopped working - pops up Zotero dialog again.  It does seem to save it though.  Maybe - that could be autosaving.
It seems to work OK in Firefox though - maybe because I don't have Zotero extension installed there.   that's OK, I can work with FF for the experimentation.

Useful tensorboard videos:

It looks pretty straightforward to use tensorboard. Create a SummaryWriter and call methods to add stats etc for the epoch, or as global metadata.  Cool.
