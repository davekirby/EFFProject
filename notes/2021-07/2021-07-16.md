Today I want to find a suitable dataset for larger scale testing than iris.  

Desirable properties:
- 1000+ rows
- 10-20 features
- all numerical features, not categorical
- reasonably balanced
- small number of target classes
- 

I think I have a potential candidate in the statlog image segmentation dataset.  Will give it a go over the weekend.

I am going to try the sklearn random forest on the iris dataset to see how well it does.  

... RF got 100% accuracy and ran in 129ms - very different to EFF.  However it is possible to memorise more of the data since I was not using a test set.
