To do:
- [x] add tensorboard calls to write_stats function
- [x] test tensorboard output
- [ ] run against other datasets
- [ ] implement mini batch processing
- [ ] tune hyperparameters against different datasets
    - [ ] use cross validation + random grid

Huzzah!  I have it working outputting the stats to tensorboard.  Currently just the same stats as go to the DEAP Stats instance, but I can now add more stuff:
-  save hyperparameters
-  histogram of sizes, fitnesses?
-  image of the history graph?
-  text of best rule


Hmmm.  Saving hparams is not working.   Tensorboard shows the names but says there are no values saved.  

I have resorted to saving the hparams as text.  I also save the best ruleset as text and histograms of the fitness, size, and rule count.   Time to commit. 

I want to have another go at saving hyperparameters properly, not as text.
