In the process of adding tensorboard support to the classifier.
Hmmm... looks like the writer in the tensorboard package only supports writing scalars.    Will have to install tensorflow as well. That sucks.  
Damn, I can't update via conda because I have a bunch of conflicting packages.  I will try and update everything tomorrow.
