Got the chromosome to fuzzy rule conversion working yesterday.  Today I want to turn the chromosome into a list of rules.  Once I have that I will refactor it into a python module and this story will be complete.

Hmm... my original story point estimate totaled 62 points and starting from the last exam, I have 15 weeks so need to average 4.133.. points per week.  Two weeks in and I have done 16 points, so at this rate I would be done in half the time.  I doubt everything will go to schedule though.

**22:03**  Managed to create a chromosome consisting of a list of rules.
