Still to do:
- add mate and mutate for entire rules
- experiment with different datasets
    - tune the hyperparameters
- clean up the code

I have added code to mutate by replacing an individual rule with a newly created random one, and mate by swapping over two rules randomly selected from the parents.  Both have a default prob of 0.1.
I have not added code to increase or decrease the number of rules though.  I may experiment with that at some point.  

The result of running 20 pop \* 20 gen is highly variable - sometimes it gets stuck with an error rate of 0.33, sometimes drops to 0.02.  Min size varies a lot too.  
I will have to experiment with the hyperparams to see if I can get it to converge more quickly.
