Need to update the mate and mutate methods to return proper Instances, not single trees.

I have removed the decorators that limit the mate and mutate heights for now, since they are operating on the list of rules, not individual rules. I can add it back explicitly in the mate and mutate methods later.

Now it fails in gp.mutUniform with `AttributeError: 'Individual' object has no attribute 'searchSubtree'`
Fixed that - was trying to mutate the rule list, not the selected rule.

Now it fails in setitem with `AttributeError: 'PrimitiveTree' object has no attribute 'arity'`
That is because it is using toolbox.expr to create the subtree, but that returns a list of trees.  Doh!

Success... almost... it is now working, but not populating the HOF.  
Fixed that...but I really don't trust the accuracy scores.  Will investigate tomorrow.
Duh... I was minimising the accuracy instead of the error.

Cool... error rate of 12% with pop of 20 and 20 generations.   Best rule set:
```
IF NOT-petal_width[low] THEN virginica[likely]
IF NOT-petal_length[high] THEN setosa[likely]
IF sepal_width[high] OR (NOT-petal_width[higher]) THEN versicolor[likely]
IF petal_length[average] AND petal_width[higher] THEN versicolor[likely]
```

This is slightly better than I got by hand - that was an error of 20/150 or 13.33~ 
Will play around with it to see if I can improve it tomorrow.
