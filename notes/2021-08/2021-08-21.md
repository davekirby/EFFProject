Looking at screen recorders to save videos of gymrunner in action.  Found a top-10 list:

Going to try out simplescreenrecorder first since it is in the ubuntu repo.

Damn, recorded the video with ssr but it did not catch my commentary.  I will see if I can dub that in later.  May need to install video editing software.  
Using the headset mono setting for audio works OK, so may be simpler to record a new video.

**11:24** recorded a new video. the game display was partly off screen which is a shame - it put it in a different position than last time.  It will do though.

Hot damn!  Saving and loading the population with pickle works now - some of my refactoring must have fixed the issue I had before.  I will add save and load methods to the base class.  But maybe that was because I had not created a new runner, so the class and functions had not changed.
