Carrying on with the #report notes.  
Not sure how much detail needs to go into the implementation section, and how much should be comments/docstrings in the code.  Maybe both.

I plan to try writing the report so that it is releasable as much of the time as possible - write a minimal acceptable amount for each section first, then flesh them out a bit at a time.  This way if I run out of time to say everything I want, I still have something to release.  I will need to start doing work early in the morning until it is finished, and get up and start work as soon as the alarm goes off.

Need to find out if I can include plain latex in the pandoc markdown or template it in some way so I can add a custom front page.
Apparently you can:

**22:20** Added EWMA to fitness calculation, so will retain some memory of previous fitness, if any.  Defaults to 1, so no remembering.
Should do a literature search to see if that has been done before.

...hmmm.... has not made much difference to the segmentation classifier with a value of 0.75.
Will try it on lunar lander....
...seems pretty much the same too.  Disappointing.
I think there is something wrong with the code though - e.g. forgetting is set to 0.5, but I have e.g. a best fitness of 237 followed by one of 54.  If elitism and EWMA are working then the score should include half that the next time round so would have to have a big negative score the next time.  That is possible I guess.
