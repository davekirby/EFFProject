Last night/this morning tried Bipedal Walker for 100 pop x 20 generations.  Not bad - had to redo because save & load was broken, but top fitness went from -34 to 30 on the second run - it learn't to fall to one knee and drag itself with the other leg, so did not fall over.  Wonder what would happen if I kept training - I saw one version on youtube that was trained for 1000 generations.  

Back to the write-up.
