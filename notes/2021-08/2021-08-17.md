Crazy idea - turn the 5-fold CV round to train on the small fold and evaluate on the big fold - this will make training a lot quicker but will probably be very inaccurate.  It should be a simple change, just swap the train and test indexes.  Giving it a "quick" go...

This morning tried small batch size and large number of small rules.  REsulted in similar accuracy to previous results.  Good on the training set but not too good on the test set.

I should probably log the test accuracy at each generation so I can plot that too, instead of once right at the end.

Carrying on with the notes for the report... where was I yesterday?
Was working on the [[Implementation Notes]].

Strange - increased the pop size to 100 and batch size down to 10 and the training accuracy went to 100% very quickly - 2-3 generations on the small dataset, but the test accuracy was pants - barely better than the average (~0.5).
