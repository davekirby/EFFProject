What do I want to say about DEAP?
- not simple library to use like sklearn.  Collection of components for building EC systems
- Toolbox class to register functions with bound parameters
- creator module for defining classes with bound attributes
    - creates the class dynamically in the creator module
    - => must do it at the top level or it warns of it being overwritten
- algorithms that take a toolbox instance and call functions bound to it
    - => must implement the expected functions
- GP support
    - define PrimitiveSet 
        - add Primitives
            - functions
            - terminals 
                - constants
                - input values
                - parameterless functions (arity of 0)
            - ephemeral constants
                - functions that are called once when the tree is created
                - created at gp module level, which can cause problems
        - PrimitiveSet may be typed or untyped
    - a tree is represented by list of primitives in prefix order
    - gp.compile function converts the tree into a python callable function by first converting it to a lambda string then calling eval on it

    **17:39** Finished the DEAP write up.
    
    To Do:
    - [ ] #task Expand info on sklearn and FIS in general
    - [ ] #task add overview of the architecture
    - [ ] #task add Gym overview
    - [ ] #task add tensorboardX overview
    - [ ]
