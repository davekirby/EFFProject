Carrying on with looking at refactoring to make adding a RL class easier - 
[[Extend evaluator for RL - 5 sp]].
What does the Gym interface look like?  

- Class based (common base class to classifier).
- same `__init__` method as classifer
    - can also do the initialisation done in the fit method
- run method
    - parameters?
        - env
        - antecedent terms (observations) & consequent terms (actions)
            - more complex than classifier - need to specify the range for each one
             - or figure out antecendent/consequents from obs/action_space?
            - pass in lists of actual Antecedent and Consequent instances.
            - write helper functions for creating them
    - tensorboard_writer

- `_evaluate` method
    - run the gym loop until the 'done' flag is set
    - add a 'max iterations' parameter to the init method?
        - or use the max_generation hyperparameter?


Also looking at other [[profilers]] as alternatives to py-spy.
