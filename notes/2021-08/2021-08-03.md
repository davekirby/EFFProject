Missed almost a whole week - tied up with Xmas and stuff.    I am thinking of diving into reinforcement learning with Gym.  Maybe come back to classification later with some fresh ideas.    I will not mark the story as done, but move onto the next one anyway.  Maybe add an 'on hold' column to the kanban?

I found a <1hr video on O'Reilly about using [[OpenAI Gym]] - the docs are a bit sparse.  Also there are a couple of books on it.
