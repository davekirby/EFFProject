To  do:
- [ ] find out why 'best size' stat is 0
- [ ] write more notes on the report

Duh... `self.population_` is not set until the run finishes.  
Fixed it by initialising self.population_ directly and removing the population temporary variable. 

Trying segmentation classifier with increased number of rules. (10-12) and smaller tree height limit.

Also thinking about extending the predict/evaluate functionality to optionally include the top n individuals, either through simple vote or weighted by fitness.  I think this would be more viable for classifier than gym though.

**22:37** The segmentation run has finished at last.  Better results than before.
More thoughts on improving segmentation classifier:
1. smaller batch size and fewer iterations
2. add hyperparam to control number of consequents on each rule.
