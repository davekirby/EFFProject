# 2021-08-28
First day of two weeks off work - 14 days to get this finished.
Process:  
- pick a section
- 25m pomodoro freewriting/brainstorming/organising what needs to go in it
- further pomodoros doing the writing & editing.
- cycle through the sections.  When stuck on one move to the next.

things to try: 
- standing dictation
- chrome web blocker and pomodoro timer


I also want to try new data sets for classifier.  

# Pomodoros

| time  | task           | notes              |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| 11:02 | overview of GP |                    |
| 11:51 | write up GP    | standing dictation |
| 17:07 | " "            | sitting                   |

**15:32** Tried the openml Wisconsin breast cancer dataset.   Better results than segmentation data set - 
In [55]: data = [0.9191176470588235, 0.7867647058823529, 0.9708029197080292, 0.6861313868613139, 0.9416058394160584]  
  
In [56]: stat.fmean(data), stat.stdev(data)  
Out[56]: (0.8608844997853156, 0.12043824919467272)

A rather imbalanced data set though - 444 benign, 239 malignant.

I want to quickly draw diagrams for GP mutate & mate - plantuml does not cut it.  Or grab a diagram from the net - https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Illustration-of-the-genetic-programming-mutation-and-crossover-The-upper-left-expression_fig1_301846559 is a good candidate, but I don;t know what the copyright implications are.  
Maybe use http://webgraphviz.com/ to draw it.
Installed graphviz plugin for vscode.

First cut: 
```
digraph G {

subgraph cluster0 {
  node [style=filled];
  "sin" -> "+";
  "+" -> "x";
  "+" -> "3";
}

subgraph cluster1 {
  node [style=filled];
  "sqrt" -> "log";
  "log" -> "*";
  "*" -> "y";
  "*" -> "10";
 }

"3" -> "log";
"log" -> "3";
}
```

**21:12** Learnt more about dot and graphviz but not managed to write any more text.  
- you can add invisible nodes and edges to control the layout a bit
- you can use dot to output a file with positions encoded, then edit that and run through neato to regenerate the links 
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8002352/how-to-control-subgraphs-layout-in-dot

Also installed graphviz plugin for vscode but not configured it yet.
