Starting later today since had to work in the garden.

I need to start the write up soon - will start off by making notes and outlining in Obsidian.  
Also I want to generate antecedents and consequents automatically from the env, at least for a subset of spaces.  Then I can easily try it on more environments.  

**21:46** Damn, I have added code to derive the antecendents and consequents from the env, but now it does not work properly.  
The mountaincar script has a permanent score of 0 for all members.  The cartpole does work but not scoring as high as before - it was regularly hitting 500 but now struggles to get to 300.
Fixed the mountaincar problem - was getting a non-existent action since I had changed the name to action_0, action

I think the problem with the cartpole is that the bounds are set to +/- inf for some observations.   How does that work with the fuzzy sets?
Yep, two of the observations range from -3.4e38 to 3.4e38, so rather a large range.  I am amazed it scored as well as it does!
I will make setting the antecedents manually an option.
Phew, got it working again.
