Going to have a quick go at fixing the save & load by not using the creator module to create classes and use regular classes instead.  
... nope, don't think it will work.  Will need a deep rewrite of the way things work, including deap internals I think.
Back to the other task at hand - extend GymRunner to allow Box action_states. 
Going to use "MountainCarContinuous-v0"


**21:50** Cool, it works - it can solve MountainCarContinuous.  
At the moment it is pretty hard coded to a single action and you have to specify what the range is.  Tomorrow I shall automate generating the consequents from the env.action_space.   And maybe the antecedents from the observation_space.   Then I can make a generic script that lets you specify the environment on the command line.
Maybe also use something like the fire package to let you configure everything on the command line.
