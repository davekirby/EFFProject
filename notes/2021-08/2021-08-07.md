Carrying on with [[Extend evaluator for RL - 5 sp]] - doing refactorings and making a Gym subclass.

The tricky part will be mapping antecendents & consequents to the observations and actions.  
Issues:
- some actions are floats and some are boolean or integer.  Need different ways of converting consequents to actions
- how to handle large numbers of antecedents, e.g. bitmap graphics or memory maps?
    - write a function to convert them to a large list of Antecedent instances?  
    - have parameterizable Antecedents that can take ephemeral constants for the memory location?
        - no idea how to include that!
        -   

One problem I have is a lack of unit tests for the classifier.     I have cut down the iris script to 5 generations so can do 5-fold CV in less than 1 min.  
**12:51** I have lifted and shifted common code into a base class in a new file.    I think I am ready to create the GymRunner class after lunch.

**16:30** The bulk of the gymrunner class is done.  The hard part remains of mapping the antecedents and consequents to the observations and actions.  For now I will hard-code it for cartpole.  

Observations:
0: cart pos (-2.4,  +2.4)
1: cart velocity  (-1, 1)
2: pole angle (-0.25, 0.25)
3: angular velocity  (-2, 2)
