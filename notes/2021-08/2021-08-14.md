Debugging the exception I got yesterday when trying to run LunarLander.  
It is trying to create a triangle term with all values are NaN.

Added temporary hack to set the limits to +/- 100 - now runs and gives a reasonable performance, although I don't think the engines ever fire, so it just plunges to its doom. 
To Do:
- [ ] make the limits configurable
    - [ ] add an optional limit on the number of iterations (only if inf?)
- [ ] change handling of HoF to evalute them every generation/batch
    - maybe just keep the entire population sorted?


Time to start preparing for [[Write project report - 13 sp|writing the report]].  I can do that in parallel with experimenting with gymrunner.  

Started on the outline but not got far.  Still need to fix the HoF issue.

Looking at replaceing the HoF with sorting the population instead
- pass hall_of_fame_size to ea_with_elitism function instead of a HoF object
- replace self.best with self.population_[-1]
- evaluate population (or unfit sub-population) then sort

**21:17** I have implemented the change.  It seems to make no difference to the classifiers though - iris and segmentation give pretty much the same results.  
Duh... still not evaluation the HoF members - and evaluating everyone else twice!
