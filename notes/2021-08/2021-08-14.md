Debugging the exception I got yesterday when trying to run LunarLander.  
It is trying to create a triangle term with all values are NaN.

Added temporary hack to set the limits to +/- 100 - now runs and gives a reasonable performance, although I don't think the engines ever fire, so it just plunges to its doom. 
To Do:
- [ ] make the limits configurable
    - [ ] add an optional limit on the number of iterations (only if inf?)
- [ ] change handling of HoF to evalute them every generation/batch
    - maybe just keep the entire population sorted?


Time to start preparing for [[Write project report - 13 sp|writing the report]].  I can do that in parallel with experimenting with gymrunner.
