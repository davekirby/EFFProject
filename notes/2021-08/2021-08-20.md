Ran LunarLanderContinous for 500 generations this morning - results were a lot better, but still room for improvement.  Doing another 500 generations to see if it gets even better.    It took about 56 mins first time round, so expect about the same.

Carrying on with making notes for the write-up.

**20:53** wow, the run has not finished yet, but it is consistently getting 200+ now.  I think it has cracked it.

Does skfuzzy have a way to load rules from the text representation?  I think it might.  ...or maybe not.  Can't find anything in the source code.  I may try pickling the population and see what happens when it finishes.

Why does the graph not show links?  Is it a linux bug?  Will restarting Obsidian fix it?

**22:41**  The lander has finished - bloody amazing.
The final rule set:
```
IF obs_4[high] THEN action_1[higher] 
IF obs_1[lower] THEN action_0[low] 
IF obs_2[lower] THEN action_1[high] 
IF obs_3[low] THEN action_0[high] 
IF obs_0[high] THEN [action_0[low], action_1[lower]] 
IF obs_4[low] THEN action_1[lower] 
IF obs_0[low] THEN [action_0[lower], action_1[higher]] 
IF obs_6[lower] THEN action_1[lower]
```

Tomorrow I will try and video capture it doing its thing before I kill the kernel and lose it forever.
