To do today:  Finish the intro.  Start on next section, whichever that is.  Aim to get something down in each section.
Made good progress with the cancer dataset - much better results.  That makes a better use case than the segmentation.  
What else?  Looked into doing diagrams to illustrate crossover and mutation using graphviz.  Probably spent longer looking that it would have taken me to draw them by hand.  Cest la vie.   Still have not created the diagrams, but now I know how to do the layout - two options, use a pipeline of graphviz commands or use hidden nodes/edges.  
Still an awful lot left to write.  
Still need to fix the parameter passing to be more compatible with sklearn.  Do other sklearn fit methods take additional parameters?  Will check...
Some do, e.g. DecisionTreeRegressor.

Hmmm... discovered that sklearn has a 'toy' dataset of the wisconsin cancer set, but it has 30 columns instead of 9.  I wonder how well it would do on that.  On the other hand it has 130 fewer rows.
