Today, back to planning/writing the report.

I want to find another dataset to try classification on - somewhere between iris and segmentation.  Not too big cos it takes ages, not too wide since that needs lots of rules and takes ages.  

A possible candidate is the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset - this would show the use for medical research
