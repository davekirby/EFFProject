Yesterday I got it working with automatically generating the antecedents and consequents from the observation/action spaces.  
I want to try it out on some other environments before starting the report this weekend.  Will create a short notebook that will let me run it interactively...

**21:50**  Damn, just realised that the hall of fame individuals are not re-evaluated since (I think) they are added back into the population after the re-evaluation is done.  So a lucky individual who gets a high score once will stay there even if they suck the rest of the time.    Noticed this with the Pendulum gym env. The winner does either really well or really bad, depending on the starting position.  Will have to think carefully how to fix this - maybe not tonight.

Also when trying to run LunarLander it fails with
```
~/anaconda3/envs/eff/lib/python3.9/site-packages/skfuzzy/membership/generatemf.py in trimf(x, abc)
 435 assert a <= b and b <= c, 'abc requires the three elements a <= b <= c.'
AssertionError: abc requires the three elements a <= b <= c.
```
Also the observations are all +/- inf for this env.  Maybe add an optional upper limit to the observations?
