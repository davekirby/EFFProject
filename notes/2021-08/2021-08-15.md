Damn, tried running gymrunner against the pendulum and it did not perform well with the new changes.  Also the best value did not change which suggests it is still not being re-evaluated.   Strange.
Reviewed the code and am pretty sure it is being re-evaluated though.  Maybe the env is restarting in the same state each time, so it is performing the same.   But then when I 'play' it afterwards it goes through the same code, so should be the same.
Can I write a unit test to check all this?  Maybe, but I need to get on with the report...

Objective for today:
- [ ] write initial notes on what I want to cover in each section
- [ ] watch training on report writing?

I am tagging report notes with #report to make it easier to manage them.

- [ ] #task make classifier sklearn compatible
    - [ ] add tests for it
