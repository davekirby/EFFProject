Removed warm_start flag from FuzzyBase.execute and made it the default behaviour.

Finished results summary.   Moving on to the next section - [[architecture and design notes]]

**15:32** Played with plantuml class diagrams and pycharm diagrams for a bit.  Neither really work for me.  Installing Archimate to try that.
... nope, that is not what I want either.

So what is it I need?
- show the classes & methods AND free functions AND relationships between them
- maybe two different diagrams?
- Only show key/public methods?  
- have a sequence diagram to show function calls between classes and global functions?
- draw as an activity diagram?
None of the sample projects have an 'architecture' section - maybe should rename it to something more meaningful to the project.
