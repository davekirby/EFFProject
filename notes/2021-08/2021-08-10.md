To do today:
- [ ] add save and load of the population
    - [ ] save params etc as well?  Maybe not
    - [ ] don't reset population if loaded from disk!
    - [ ] unit tests for it?
-  [ ] figure out how to do alternative action & observation environments


Damn, can't pickle the population - it barfs when you try to run the newly loaded population:
> _pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <class 'deap.creator.Individual'>: it's not the same object as deap.creator.Individual

because it creates a new Individual class.
