To do today:
- [ ] add save and load of the population
    - [ ] save params etc as well?  Maybe not
    - [ ] don't reset population if loaded from disk!
    - [ ] unit tests for it?
-  [ ] figure out how to do alternative action & observation environments

I have parked the save&load code on a branch `adding-save-and-load`
Back to thinking about handling other env types, especially where the output is one or more floats.  e.g. MountainCarContinuous needs an action between -1 and 1.
Currently I pass a dict for discrete actions mapping names to values.  Maybe pass a dict with a tuple of (min, max) instead.  I could also have a function to generate the dict from the env.action_state.    Can include the number of terms as well.  The output can be the straightforward classifier output.  

Damn, can't pickle the population - it barfs when you try to run the newly loaded population:
> _pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <class 'deap.creator.Individual'>: it's not the same object as deap.creator.Individual

because it creates a new Individual class.
