Had the thought over the weekend that I should re-evaluate all the population each generation for RL - otherwise I may get one that is successful on one initial setting but not others.  
Also today I want to display the end result and print the rules.  

**20:38** Cool, got it printing the rule and showing the rule in action.  
Next I need to try it on similar environments and  think about how to generalise it to environments with other types of observations and actions...
