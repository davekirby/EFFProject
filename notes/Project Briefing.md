# Plagiarism
can lose points for quoting too much to pad out

Too many citations can lose marks!

Reword stuff from your proposal - don't self-plagiarise

Word count != quality - don't try to pad it

Don't let your work be plagiarised by others.

Ask supervisor for general feedback on proposal.

- start as soon as possible
- Suggested structure template
    - Abstract
    - Introduction & Background
        - put reader in context
        - don't describe the project - do that in the rest of the report

        - 
    - Overall results - project trailer
        - show off how great the project is!
    - main features/requirements
        - process for obtaining them

    - Testing
    - Methodology and Schedule
    - Tools and Technologies
    - Summary and Conclusion
    - References
    - Appendix
        - User Manual

Avoid making the reader jump back and forth.
Length of sections should be proportional to importance.
Arrange from most interesting to least interesting

# Titles
- fit the content
- don't have generic titles

# Presention Techniques
- Top down
- Bottom Up
- Linear Story

# What, Why, What, were
Choice of language etc:
- what you chose
- why you chose
- other options
    - least relevant - not longer than other sections
- don't add irrelevant detail, history etc

Avoid first person, but not critical.

Avoid out of context information.  

Avoid redundant text that adds no useful information.

Forget about word count.

Don't use unexplained technical jargon - explain it & show you know what you are writing about. 

Don't make the report too technical.


# working on the project
- update supervisor at agreed times
- don't do too much work without updating him
- start report as soon as possible
    - fill out the structure
    - plan what you want to write in each section
        - don't write the actual text initially
- create top to bottom implementation and spread out sideways
- contact supervisor when stuck
- don't go on tangent without discussing it w. supervisor
- don't spend forever looked for the best option - go for one that is good enough.
- Avoid Impressionism - focusing on impressing supervisor and not project
    - get graded on code & report, not the route there.  
- Avoid Perfectionism
