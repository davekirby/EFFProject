Having problems getting the chromosome to rule conversion working.  Returning a list of consequents gets converted to a list of strings with the consequent names.  Also the antecedents come out as None.   I think I will need to investigate the gp.compile code with the debugger.

**18:25**  I finally got it to create a rule - I had to use a class for the consequent that had a `__repr__` method to return the string in the right format.   Phew. 

Currently it is only creating trees of depth 1, will have to investigate why that is later.
