Having problems getting the chromosome to rule conversion working.  Returning a list of consequents gets converted to a list of strings with the consequent names.  Also the antecedents come out as None.   I think I will need to investigate the gp.compile code with the debugger.

**18:25**  I finally got it to create a rule - I had to use a class for the consequent that had a `__repr__` method to return the string in the right format.   Phew. 

Currently it is only creating trees of depth 1, will have to investigate why that is later.
Also the 'ephemeralConstant' isn't - it is regenerating the value every time I compile the Instance.  
... fixed that - I was generating the value in the repr method, not the init method.

It is still unclear to me how the tree size is determined - increasing the max depth seemed to reduce the tree size.  Will have to investigate further.
