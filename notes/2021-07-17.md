Yesterday I picked a dataset to [[Experiment and Tune Classifier 5sp]] with.  Today I will install it and write a script to run the classifer on it, then experiment with the hyperparameters.

Also add an optional tensorboard_writer parameter to the evaluate function so I can record the test results.

I want to update the iris script first for adding train-test split and cross validation.  The problem is controlling the tensorboard output directory when doing the cross validation and test.  

I have updated the iris script to do 5-fold CV.  I am doing a train-test split as well, but not used the test set at the moment.
