Working on learning DEAP gp and applying it to creating fuzzy rules.  Starting with the example in the hands-on book.

I have gone through the example and played around with the parameters.  There is a lot of variation in the results, which is to be expected.  

Thinking about what would be required to create an individual representing a fuzzy rule.

primitiveSet:
- add a terminal for each fuzzy term of each Antecedent
- add a terminal for each fuzzy term of each Consequent



Struggled a bit getting Jupyter to display a pygraphviz object without saving it, but finally managed it.  Simpler than I though - g.draw(format="png") returns a byte string with the data, then pass that to IPython.display.Image.
