I have played around with how the number of rules changes over the generations.  
Just randomly selecting with replacement from a list of numbers in a limited range will have the same effect as one number dominates and takes over the list.  Replacing a small number (e.g. 5) with new random values seems to work well to prevent this.  This means that adding some fresh individuals to replace the worst performers should preserve diversity, so I will implement that today.
That means another hyperparameter to add - the number of individuals to replace.
What should I call that?  replacements?  death_row?  hall_of_shame?
