Took a couple of days break due to the heat and my ear playing up.
I need to improve the convergence on the new dataset by batch processing it.  
I could do that at the outer level, but would be better to do it inside the classifier. 
Will need to control with some hyperparameters:
- batch size - if 0 then don't batch
- verbosity?  - print/tensorflow stats every batch or every at the end of every pass
-
