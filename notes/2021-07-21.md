Took a couple of days break due to the heat and my ear playing up.
I need to improve the convergence on the new dataset by batch processing it.  
I could do that at the outer level, but would be better to do it inside the classifier. 
Will need to control with some hyperparameters:
- batch size - if 0 then don't batch
- verbosity?  - print/tensorflow stats every batch or every at the end of every pass

Will leave verbosity for now...

I found there is a function to get an sklearn.metrics function from the string - can use that to make the metric to use a hyperparameter like other classifiers in sklearn.

Making batches is tricky - the X is bound to the evaluate function.  

Phew - timed the current 5-fold CV on the data - took 53m 54s for an accuracy of about 40%.
For comparison RandomForest took about 2s and scored 97% +/- 1
We have some way to go!
