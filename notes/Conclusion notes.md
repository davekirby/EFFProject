It works!
- useful for small datasets that need explainability
    - e.g. medical diagnosis

Viable for RL in simple environments.    Not yet tested in larger environments.

Drawbacks:
- a lot of hyperparameters to tune
    - sloooow
    - may be slow to converge for some problems
    - may not learn at all for some!
