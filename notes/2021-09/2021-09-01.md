Carrying on with the architecture / design write up.

**14:12** I am writing up the architecture & design part, but want to go through the code and rename things & add docstrings first, so the names don't get out of sync with the report.
Refactoring with Pycharm may be a problem because registering with the toolbox breaks the connection with the original function.
