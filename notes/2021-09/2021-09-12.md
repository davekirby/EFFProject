Finished the conclusion write up yesterday.  
Was up late watching the US Open final last night, so a bit bleary.

To Do:
- [ ] write the readme
- [ ] list of figures?
- [ ] add brief schedule section to implementation?
- [ ] add unit tests to the appendix
    - [ ] expand on unit tests?
- [X] fix bibliography - add missing citations
- [ ] do a review pass over the doc.
    - [ ] rewrite parts
    - [ ] grammar check?
    - cut down some stuff?


What do I need to do to add the required references to the bibliography?  Will need to brush up...
Pandoc can accept multiple --bibliography entries, so can export to a new file and go from there.  Or is there a way for the zotero plugin to append to a file?

Added the required page header.  Bit of a pain, having to use fancyhdr package.
