Started writing the user guide yesterday.  Need to finish it today.

**17:03** noticed that some of the hyperparameters are not used!  Will remove them.

**17:29** Hmmm... also noticed that the mutate operator select adjacent pairs of offsprings to mate.  Are they randomly ordered at this point?  If not I should shuffle them to increase diversity.  
It should be OK - they have just been randomly selected through the double tournament, so will be unordered.
