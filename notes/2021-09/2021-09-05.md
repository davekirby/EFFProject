Plan to finish the user guide today and start on the implementation section - there should be some overlap between the two.

Still to cover:
batch_size and memory_decay hyperparams.  
Using the package

- common code 
    - initialise with hyperparameters
        - list them all with meanings
    - use of tensorboard
    - best, best_size, best_str
    - save & load
    - best_n

- FuzzyClassifier 
    - fit method
        - classes parameter
            - maps names to the value in the y 
        - antecedent_terms
        - columns
        - tensorboard_writer
        - 
    - predict method
        - optional n parameter
            - rename?

- GymRunner
    - train
    - play

Oops - found a bug in my pd.DataFrame creation.  Does not work the way I expect.  Fixed it.

**15:02** Added a table of hyperparamters but the layout is screwed - columns overlapping each other.  
Looks like a known bug in pandoc.  Damn.
