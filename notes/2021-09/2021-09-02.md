Carrying on with architecture / design write up...
Was also updating the code to refactor and add docstrings. Will leave that for now since I think finishing the report is higher priority.

First pass at the design write-up done - need to go into detail on how to use the classes.   Maybe put a reference to the user guide and leave it at that.
Need more detail on Antecendents and Consequents, and the FIS side of things in general.
