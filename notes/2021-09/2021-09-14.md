Was in hospital yesterday and this morning.  So did not get anything more done.

To Do:
- [ ] write the readme
- [ ] add unit tests to the appendix
    - [ ] expand on unit tests?
- [ ] do another review pass over the doc?
    - [ ] rewrite parts
    - [ ] grammar check?
    - [ ] play back via tts?

I have uploaded the current draft to moodle, just in case of another emergency before Thursday night.

Time to write the readme.  What does the project blurb say needs to go in it?
> The CD or USB drive should include an ASCII file called README.TXT with description of the files provided and instructions on software execution.

It is not mentioned in the slides, so I don't think it is too important.  Will add it anyway.
