Still working on the design write up...  

to do:
- add more detail on how skfuzzy is used and the main components
- start on next section or user manual?
    - finish refactoring before start user manual - move parameters
- 


| start | task                          | duration | notes | break |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ----- |
| 10:22 | update sklearn description    | 59:25    |       |       |
| 11:50 | " "                           | 22:40    |       |       |
| 14:15 | implementation & test section | 35:05    |       |       |
| 15:15 | " "                           | 41:01    |       | 4:32  |
| 16:02 | user manual                   | 30:44    |       |       |
| 17:23 | " "                           |          |       |       |

I think I have enough on skfuzzy.  What next?
- Start user manual?
- Implementation details?
What needs to go in the implementation section?  
- development process
- issues and decisions
- 

Moving the class-specific hyperparameters to the `__init__` method.

**15:50** I am having second thoughts about moving the parameters from fit/train to init - the classes & antecedents are closely tied in with the dataset or env - they are not hyperparameters as such.  The exception is inf_limit, but even that is debatable.    I think I will leave them as they are.
I have reverted the code.  I will start on the user manual now....

**17:28** damn, thought I had renamed the forgetting parameter but it is unchanged.  What was I going to rename it to?  memory_decay? fitness_decay?  I think it was better than either of those.  Will go with fitness_decay for now.
Duh!  I had changed it to memory_decay in fuzzygp.py, but nowhere else.
