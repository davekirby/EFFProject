Still working on the design write up...  

to do:
- add more detail on how skfuzzy is used and the main components
- start on next section or user manual?
    - finish refactoring before start user manual - move parameters
- 


| start | task                       | duration | notes |
| ----- | -------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| 10:22 | update sklearn description | 59:25    |       |
| 11:50 | " "                        | 22:40    |       |
|       |                            |          |       |

I think I have enough on skfuzzy.  What next?
- Start user manual?
- Implementation details?
