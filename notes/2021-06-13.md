Creating a notebook to play around with fuzzy rule chromosomes.

1. create the antecedents and consequents
2. write a function that takes a list of antecedents and consequents, and generates the PrimitiveSetTyped
3. create an ephemeral constant of type list for the consequents


**15:02** I have Created the primitiveSet and toolbox functions and can generate an individual, but not figured out yet how to turn it into a proper rule.  
**15:29** I am getting close, but when I try to create an individual it fails with
```
IndexError: The gp.generate function tried to add a primitive of type '<class 'list'>', but there is none available.
```
even though I have an ephemeral constant with that type.  Is this a bug in DEAP or my understanding of it?
