Still trying to install tensorflow - using --no-pin option had no effect.  I thinks for hours before giving up.  
I think I will need to create a new venv.  Wonder if you can rename them?

I have re-installed anaconda and build a new eff environment.

I now have tensorflow and all the other libraries installed, but conda still complains about mismatched packages.  
Over the weekend I will finish adding support for tensorboard output and start tuning and experimenting with other data sets.
