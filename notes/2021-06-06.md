I have implemented a simple fuzzy classifier that takes pandas dataframe with column names that match the antecendents, a list of rules, and a dict mapping the consequent names to the output class.   It returns a list of the predicted output class.  

I could extend it to take other things than a pandas dataframe, i.e. a numpy array and list of column names, but this will do for now.  I think I have done enough to mark the story as done and move on to the next one.
