# Objective
Create a proof-of-concept inference system to act as a classifier for a simple dataset such as iris.   Initially the rules will be hand written.  
Thoughts:
- should be designed to fit into scikit-learn pipeline.  
- take a pandas dataframe with the data and maybe a dict of the fuzzy set names for each input and output variable
- takes a fuzzy rule set and applies it to the data
- use argmax of the defuzzified output of each class to make a prediction
- should be able to use standard sklearn metrics on the result.

It should be possible to do most of this directly with the skfuzzy library high level interface. 

- [x] #task experiment with [[scikit-fuzzy]] ✅ 2021-06-13
    - [x] create a notebook in jupyter lab
- [x] #task create simple iris classifier with hand-coded rules ✅ 2021-06-13

So what rules do I want to implement?
Here are the ranges of values:

| param        | min | max |
| ------------ | --- | --- |
| sepal length | 4.3 | 7.9 |
| sepal width  | 2.0 | 4.4 |
| petal length | 1.0 | 6.9 |
| petal width  | 0.1 | 2.5 | 

Use 5 set names:  very short, short, medium, long, very long.
Does skfuzzy have hedges?  Doesn't look like it, but I think they are simple to implement as a function on the numpy arrays.  Maybe.  

IF petal width is narrow and petal length is short then cls is 0 (setosa)
IF petal width is medium and petal length is medium then cls is 1 (veriscolor)
IF petal width is wide and petal length is long then cls is 2 (virginica)

Maybe just use 3 terms for each axis then.  

Puzzling how to model the consequents:
1. have separate variables for setosa, versicolor and and verginica with a single term 'likely'
2. have one term 'category' with separate terms for each type
3. separate variables as 1 but have terms 'unlikely', 'possible', 'likely'

I will go with 1 for now and see what happens.  

Bugger, first pass threw a ValueError in the defuzzifier because there was zero area to defuzzify.  Will need to debug.
Doh!  forgot to change the variable.universe when copy-pasting the consequents.
Damn, did not make any difference.  
Also had to switch to my old keyboard due to tea on the new one.  Hope it is not fucked.  
OK, I think I know why it fails.  The data point falls in the zero region of rule 3 so the fuzzy consequent is all zero.  This is only a problem for centroid and bisector defuzzifier, so I can either set it to something else or extend the rules so that something is generated each time - maybe add 'unlikely' term and consequent to each rule.
Cool - setting the consequent defuzzifier to 'som' (smallest of max) does what I want. 
So all that is left is
- [X] #task take the argmax to find the class index
- [X] #task run fuzzy classifier on all the data and measure the performance
- [x] #task wrap fuzzy classifier up in a class or function that can be used with sklearn ✅ 2021-06-06
    - create a Classifier class - but no fit method yet

The classifer was not bad - took 99ms and had an accuracy of 130/150 = 86.6%
What do I need to do to wrap it into a reusable package?
FuzzyClassifier class:
With these inputs:
- list of rules
- dict mapping consequent names to predicted class
- 
Methods:
- predict(X)
    - X may be a dataframe with column names matching the antecedent names
    - OR X is a numpy matrix and pass a dict mapping antecedent names to column indexes.  Or a list if antecendent names in column order if 1:1 relationship
    - return a list of the predicted classes
Any other scikit-learn methods I need to include? 

I need a name for the package - eff?  fuzzy_forest? evolve_fuzzy?  evofuzzy? fuzzygp?
I think I will go with evofuzzy.
