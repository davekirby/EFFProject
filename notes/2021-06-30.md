I have emailed Felix to give him an update on the project.  

I think the next challenge is to stop it converging on a local minima.  I will have a look in the literature for ideas.  
Things to try (mostly from the GP Field Guide):
- increase mutation rate and reduce or remove mating
- have a 'hall of shame' - replace the least fit with newly generated rulesets.
- track diversity and add fresh blood if it gets too low
- smaller tournament size
- split population into demes.  


Setting mutation probability to 0.9 and crossover probability to 0.1 seems to be much more successful in avoiding local minima.

Another thought:  when using it for real classification, would it be helpful to use all the HOF members to do the prediction and take the majority vote?

Strange... every rule-set in the population is the same size.  I have re-run the script several times and got the same result.  It must be a bug but I don't see how.
