#  Abstract{- .unlisted}

Fuzzy inference systems are AI systems combining fuzzy set theory developed by Lofti Zadeh [@Zadeh-Fuzzy-1965] with IF-THEN rules to model some aspect of the real world.  They have been used for feedback control systems, classification and expert systems.  Fuzzy rules are explainable and comprehensible to laymen, but can be difficult to create and tune by hand.  

This project will implement an algorithm and python library for learning fuzzy rule systems from data through genetic programming techniques.  The algorithm and generated fuzzy rules will be evaluated against classification tasks and simple reinforcement learning applications and its strengths and weaknesses explored.
