#  Abstract{- .unlisted}

This report describes a python framework for evolving sets of fuzzy inference rules using genetic programming.  The framework was applied in two ways:
Firstly it was used for classification of simple datasets.  Although it was found to be slower and sometimes less accurate than other methods, it could be useful in situations where explainability is important since the rule set can be output in a text form understandable by non-experts.

Secondly it was used for reinforcement learning in several openAI gym environments where it was found to be effective at solving the RL problems it was tried on.
