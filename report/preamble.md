#  Abstract{- .unlisted}

A python framework was created for evolving sets of fuzzy inference rules using genetic programming.  The framework was applied in two ways:
Firstly it was used for classification of simple datasets.  Although it was found to be slower and sometimes less accurate than other methods, it could be useful in situations where explainability was important since the rule set could be output in a form understandable to non-experts.

Secondly it was used for reinforcement learning in several openAI gym environments.  It was found to be effective at solving the RL problems it was tried on.
