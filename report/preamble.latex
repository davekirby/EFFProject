A python framework was created for evolving sets of fuzzy inference
rules using genetic programming. The framework was applied in two ways:
Firstly it was used for classification of simple datasets. Although it
was found to be slower and sometimes less accurate than other methods,
it could be useful in situations where explainability was important
since the rule set could be output in a form understandable to
non-experts.

Secondly it was used for reinforcement learning in several openAI gym
environments. It was found to be effective at solving the RL problems it
was tried on.
