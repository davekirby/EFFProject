This report describes a python framework for evolving sets of fuzzy
inference rules using genetic programming. The framework was applied in
two ways: Firstly it was used for classification of simple datasets.
Although it was found to be slower and sometimes less accurate than
other methods, it could be useful in situations where explainability is
important since the rule set can be output in a text form understandable
by non-experts.

Secondly it was used for reinforcement learning in several openAI gym
environments where it was found to be effective at solving the RL
problems it was tried on.
