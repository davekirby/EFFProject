# Evolving Fuzzy Forests: creating Fuzzy Inference Systems with Genetic Programming

## A project submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the M.Sc. in Advanced Computing Technologies (Data Analytics specialisation) at Birkbeck College, University of London.  Summer Term 2021.

This project implements a Fuzzy Inference System trained through Genetic Programming that can perform two separate tasks:

1. Classification using the FuzzyClassifier class, modelled on the scikit-learn classifiers API.

2. Reinforcement learning on OpenAI Gym environments with the GymRunner class.

The prerequisites for using the package are given in requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt.  It has been developed on python 3.9 and should work with 3.7 or 3.8, but this is untested.

Instructions for using the package are in user_guide.md and there are several demo scripts for both classification and for RL.
