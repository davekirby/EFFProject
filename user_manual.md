# User Manual for the evofuzzy python package

`evofuzzy` is a python package for using Genetic Programming (GP) to evolve a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that can be used for classification and reinforcement learning in the OpenAI Gym environment.  It is built on the DEAP evolutionary computation framework and the scikit-fuzzy library, but no knowledge of these libraries is needed, but some general knowledge of FIS and GP is assumed.
